OsPoolVhdx2Vhdx is a tool allowing you to dump individual Storage Spaces from a Storage Pool present in a Vhdx file of your choice into separate Vhdx files.
Storage Spaces is a technology used in some Windows Editions to store multiple disks within a single partition space. This tool will enable you to get individual virtual disk files out of them.

## Usage Examples

- Windows Core OS OSPool -> Data.vhdx, EFIESP.vhdx, OSData.vhdx, VIRT_EFIESP.vhdx, MainOS.vhdx (etc...)
- Windows Holographic OSPool
